--- FEATURES ---
* Add database connectivity

* Instead of traditional database connectivity, maybe we develop a web service to send the data to the DB
	* Possibilities: REST, SOAP, others?
	* Perk: User won't have to install entire DBMS software -- This lifts a HUGE burden off of us and user
	* Instead of directly writing to the database, we transfer the data in a flat file (like an XML) to the server
	* A process that runs on the server picks up the file and inserts the data into the DB
	* Later: 
		* Need to add username and password fields to GUI to verify connection
			* How to validate user? Use security token of some sort?
		* Indicator on GUI letting user know they have a live connection

* Offline option
	* Compile local config that comes with program upon installation
		* This config will have all the map names, bounties, etc
	* Possibly implement an option to sync this file with an online master config that we keep updated
		* User can have the option of syncing with that file to update it when they are online sometime
		* Can host the master config on the cloud server where the DB lives

* Character class, name

--- ENHANCEMENTS ---
